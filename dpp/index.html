            <p>(NBC) - Beloved TLC star and burgeoning business woman Dr. Pimple Popper made headlines after revealing her new natural remedy for Skin Tags, Warts, Age Spots and Moles on Live TV last week. A number of big Skin Care companies were outraged saying they will be filing a lawsuit against Dr. Sandra Lee for violating her contract and undercutting their prices. She responded with this:</p>
            <p><strong><i>“When I started this whole thing back in 2023, it really was just a part-time passion project and a way for me to give back to my viewers and clients. After being given so much, I figured there was no better time to make my skin tag remover available to everyone, as it can help thousands of people experience better skin and live much happier lives.”</i></strong></p>
            <p>Her All-Natural &amp; Non-Toxic product, has been flying off the shelves within minutes and Dr. Pimple Popper says her number one struggle as CEO is being able to keep up with demand. <u>Her skin tag remover is five times more effective than those being offered by Nivea and other “Skin” companies.</u></p>
            <p><strong> Dr. Pimple Popper’s product has helped many of her clients who have seen amazing results for all their skin related ailments. Her product naturally removes numerous skin issues like <u>warts, dark moles, light moles, age spots and much more!</u> </strong></p>
            <p>L'Oréal and Unilever were furious after seeing a massive dip in their sales, calling for Dr. Pimple Popper to be indicted, saying: <i>“We’re happy Dr. Sandra Lee found something to replace our products naturally, but her announcement was a direct breach of contract. TLC should fire her immediately and she should formally apologize.“</i></p>
            <p><b>Dr. Pimple Popper appeared on Live TV the next day, not to apologize, but to offer viewers free trial bottles.</b></p>
            <img alt="" src="images/dpp2.jpg">
            <p>“I’m not going to let these companies intimidate me,” Dr. Pimple Popper fired back during her appearance. “Our product, <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click" target="_blank">Malibu MD</a>, has helped me and my clients cope with what ails us! I am so confident in it that I’m offering free trial bottles to everyone. <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click" target="_blank">Malibu MD </a> is the product of thousands of hours of research and development. I wouldn’t talk about something on air I don’t believe in and give to my family.”</p>
            <p>Dr. Pimple Popper eventually admitted that big Skin Care companies are furious with her after noticing a large decline in sales since <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click" target="_blank">Malibu MD </a> was launched on the internet.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><em>“Users of <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click" target="_blank">Malibu MD </a> are experiencing results that before now were only possible through expensive toxic products. It’s obviously a much cheaper, and safer alternative and because of that skin care companies are finding it harder to keep clients using their products.” </em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Dr. Pimple Popper's words coupled with online reports of amazing results got us curious about <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click" target="_blank">Malibu MD </a> so we did some research — here’s what we found.</p>
            <h2>Is <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click" target="_blank">Malibu MD </a> Right For You?</h2>
            <p>The short answer is Yes.</p>

            To test out the product, I applied <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click">Malibu MD</a> to a
            fairly large mole I've had on my right cheek my entire life.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <strong>THESE WERE MY RESULTS – COMPLETELY GONE IN 6 HOURS:</strong>
        </h2>

            <br>
            <p>
                Just 6 hours after applying <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click">Malibu MD</a> to my mole, I was in awe by how quick and dramatic the effects were.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the first 3 hours the mole had completely scabbed over and was already starting to flake off by hour 5. The active ingredients of <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click">Malibu MD</a> were truly miraculous.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt amazing by hour 6 when the entire mole had dried up into
                an ugly flake that literally fell right off of my cheek. All
                that was left behind was clear, smooth and natural toned healthy
                looking skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best part of all was that I didn't have to do a single thing
                other than apply the <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click">Malibu MD</a> directly on to my
                (now non-existent) mole. I always hated the idea of getting an
                expensive surgical procedure, not to mention I was terrified of
                it! That is something I'll never have to worry about ever again!
            </p>
            <p>
                Pretty much all of my friends have complimented me on how much
                better my face looks now! I know many people like to use the
                excuse that face moles are "beauty marks", but I feel way more
                beautiful without my "beauty mark". Not to mention, my husband
                has been commenting on how beautiful my face looks now as well.
                I even notice more men looking at me in a desirable sort of way
                at the grocery store.

                    <p>I was looking for a natural alternative to surgery and came
                        across
                        <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click"><b><u>Malibu MD</u></b></a><b></b>
                        and I'm amazed at how it was able to completely eliminate my
                        mole within just a few hours. And no, the mole never came back!</p>

                    <p>I wasn't really concerned about my mole enough to get surgery,
                        but when I found about this natural product it just seemed so
                        simple and easy so I went for it.
                        <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click"><b><u>Malibu MD</u></b></a><b></b>
                        is really an incredible product and I am really glad I tried it
                        because it actually completely removed my mole!</p>

                    <p>I found out about

                        from a friend who recommended it to me when I mentioned I was
                        considering getting a mole removal procedure done. Man, am I
                        ever glad I tried this before getting the procedure! This
                        product really deserves more recognition, it's simply amazing!</p>

                <h2>Will <a href="https://track.grtrckng.com/click">Malibu MD</a> Work For You?</h2>
                <p>Using <i>Sarah</i>'s mole &amp; skin tag vanishing formula, I
                    completely got rid of my mole and I've heard that it works just as
                    well for skin tags and warts. Here at our editors office, everyone could see the difference and we were all proud
                    of me for trying something new and being rewarded for it!</p>
                <p>There are countless health and skin gimmicks out there these days,
                    and most of them are high in cost and low in giving you real
                    results. So when we heard about the deal, we were skeptical —
                    could this product really be that much better than everything else
                    on the market? Seeing my results first-hand in our scientific case
                    study — along with the investors always-valuable recommendation! —
                    turned us from skeptics into believers. <strong>We can't deny it: This stuff really works and The Daily
                        Reporting is happy to officially recommend it!</strong></p>
